# Customer Attrition Project 
This is Customer Attrition Project Learning at IIMC 

*Introduction*

This project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn or attrite from a Bank's services. 

Customer attrition, or churn, is a critical challenge for credit card companies as it directly impacts revenue and customer retention rates. By proactively identifying customers at risk of attrition, the company can take appropriate actions to mitigate churn, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance profitability.

In this project, we will leverage historical customer data, including demographic information, transactional data, and customer interactions, to develop a machine-learning model capable of predicting credit card customer attrition. By identifying the key factors that contribute to churn, we can help the company take proactive steps to retain customers and develop targeted retention strategies.

*Objectives*

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1.	Build a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to attrite from bank.

2.	Provide actionable recommendations and strategies to reduce customer churn and improve customer retention rates.

*Methodology*

The project will follow the following methodology:

    a)	Data Collection: Gather historical customer data, including demographic information, transactional data, customer interactions, and churn status.

    b)	Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, handling categorical variables, and performing feature engineering if necessary.

    c)	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct an in-depth analysis of the dataset to identify patterns, correlations, and trends related to customer attrition.

    d)	Feature Selection: Select the most relevant features that contribute significantly to customer churn using techniques like correlation analysis, feature importance, or dimensionality reduction techniques.

    e)	Model Development: Develop a machine learning model to predict customer attrition using suitable algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.

    f)	Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the developed model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Employ cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness.

    g)	Interpretation and Insights: Analyze the model results and interpret the key factors influencing customer attrition. Extract actionable insights to guide business strategies and customer retention efforts.

    h)	Recommendations: Provide the credit card company with actionable recommendations and strategies to reduce customer churn, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve overall profitability.

*Deliverables*

The project will deliver the following outputs:

    a)	A predictive model capable of accurately predicting customer attrition from Bank

    b)	Documentation detailing the data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis, and model development.

    c)	Analysis and insights on key factors influencing customer attrition.
