# Customer Attrition Project 
This is Customer Attrition Project Learning at IIMC 
Introduction
The purpose of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn or attrite from a Bank services. 
Customer attrition, or churn, is a critical challenge for credit card companies as it directly impacts revenue and customer retention rates. By proactively identifying customers at risk of attrition, the company can take appropriate actions to mitigate churn, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance profitability.
In this project, we will leverage historical customer data, including demographic information, transactional data, and customer interactions, to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting credit card customer attrition. By identifying the key factors that contribute to churn, we can help the company take proactive steps to retain customers and develop targeted retention strategies.
